Prerequisites for this:
-Tensorflow (version 1.1.0)
-Python 3.6
-Keras 2 (version 2.15)
-Pandas (version 0.22)
-Numpy (version 1.12)
-Scikit-learn (version 0.19)
-Matplotlib (version 2.2.2)

This shows the use of a convolutional neural network model that was built and trained with Keras on top of Tensorflow.
This first part I focused on Machine Learning model, parameters and results. The second part I explained how to deploy this model as an API.
I trained the model on the MNIST dataset provided by Kaggle to produce good results in recognize handwritten digits.
